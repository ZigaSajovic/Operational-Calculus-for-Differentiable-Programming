\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we presented a theoretical model for differentiable programming. Throughout the course of the paper we have shown the model to be a complete description of differentiable programming.
Furthermore, the innate algebraic nature of the framework expands the descriptive power of the language with the ability to reason about the programs it implements by way of its operational calculus.
