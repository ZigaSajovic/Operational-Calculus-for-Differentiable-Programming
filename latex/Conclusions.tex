\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we presented a theoretical model for differentiable programming. Throughout the course of the paper we have shown the model to be a complete description of differentiable programming.
Furthermore, the innate algebraic nature of the framework supplements the descriptive power of a language with the ability to reason about the programs it implements, by way of its operational calculus. We have demonstrated its place as a needed step in computer science, where languages are to be endowed with algebraic constructs that hold power over analytic properties of programs they implement.
