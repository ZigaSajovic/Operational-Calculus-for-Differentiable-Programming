\section{Operational Calculus on Programming Spaces}\label{sec:operational}


By Corollary $\ref{izr:P_n}$ we may represent calculation of derivatives of the
map $P:\VV\to \VV$, with only one mapping $\sumd$. We define the operator
$\sumd_n$ as a direct sum of operators
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:DD}
    \sumd_n = 1+\D +\D^2 +\ldots + \D^n 
  \end{equation}
  
The image $\sumd_kP(\x)$ is a multi-tensor of order $k$, which is a direct sum of the map's value and all derivatives of order $n\le k$, all evaluated at the point $\x$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:multi_odvod}
  \sumd_kP(\x) = P(\mathbf{x})+\partial_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}) + \partial^2_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}) + \ldots + \partial^k_\mathbf{x} P(\mathbf{x}).
\end{equation}
The operator $\sumd_n$ satisfies the recursive relation:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:potenca(1+d)}
    \sumd_{k+1}=1+\D\sumd_{k},
  \end{equation}
that can be used to recursively construct programming spaces of arbitrary order. 
\begin{proposition}
Only explicit knowledge of $\sumd_1:\dP_0\to\dP_1$ is required for the
construction of $\dP_n$ from $\dP_1$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The construction is achieved following the argument $\eqref{eq:inductionStep}$ of the proof of Theorem \ref{izr:P}, allowing simple implementation, as dictated by $\eqref{eq:potenca(1+d)}$. 
\end{proof}
        
\begin{remark}\label{rem:vTen}
Maps $\VV\otimes T(\VV^*)\to \VV\otimes T(\VV^*)$ are constructible using
tensor algebra operations and compositions of programs in $\dP_n$.
\end{remark}
       
\begin{definition}[Algebra product]
 For any bilinear map
 $$\cdot :\VV\times \VV\to \VV$$
 we can define a
 bilinear product $\cdot$ on $\VV\otimes \T(\VV^*)$ by the following rule on the
 simple tensors:
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:algebra_product}
   (\vv\otimes f_1\otimes\ldots f_k) \cdot (\uu\otimes g_1\otimes\ldots g_l)=
(\vv\cdot \uu)\otimes f_1\otimes\ldots f_k\otimes g_1\otimes\ldots g_l 
 \end{equation}
extending linearly on the whole space $\VV\otimes\T(\VV^*)$
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Programming algebra]\label{izr:alg}
 For any bilinear map $\cdot :\VV\times \VV\to \VV$ an infinitely-differentiable
 programming space $\dP_\infty$ is a function algebra, with the product defined
 by \eqref{eq:algebra_product}.
\end{theorem}

 \subsection{Tensor Series Expansion}\label{sec:Vrsta}

With the fundamentals of our framework established, we can begin to implement operators within its algebra. We begin by implementing an operator that shifts the program from its initial value and can later be used for the implementation of iterators and composers.

In the space spanned by the set $\DD^n=\{\D^k;\quad 0\le k\le n\}$ over a field $K$, such an operator can be defined as
 \begin{equation*}
  e^{h\D}=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(h\D)^n}{n!}
 \end{equation*}
 In coordinates, the operator $e^{h\D}$ can be written as a
 series over all multi-indices $\alpha$
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:e^d}
  e^{h\D}=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{h^n}{n!}\sum_{\forall_{i,\alpha}}\frac{\partial^n}{\partial
        x_{\alpha_1}\ldots \partial x_{\alpha_n}}\e_i\otimes
      dx_{\alpha_1}\otimes\ldots \otimes dx_{\alpha_n}.
 \end{equation}
The operator $e^{h\D}$ is a mapping between programming spaces $\eqref{eq:F_n}$
 \begin{equation*}
  e^{h\D}:\dP\to\dP_\infty,
 \end{equation*}
in which partial applications can be made complete
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:specProg}
    e^{h\D}:\dP\to \Big\{\VV\to \VV\otimes \T(\VV^*)\Big\},
  \end{equation}
by taking the image of the map $e^{h\D}(P)$ at a certain point $\vv\in \VV$.  
Thus, we construct a map from the space of programs,
to the space of polynomials using  $\eqref{eq:specProg}$. Note that the space of
multivariate polynomials 
$\VV\to K$ is isomorphic to symmetric algebra $S(\VV^*)$, which is in turn a
quotient of tensor algebra $T(\VV^*)$.
To any element of
 $\VV\otimes T(\VV^*)$ one can attach corresponding element of $\VV\otimes S(\VV^*)$
 namely a polynomial map  $\VV\to \VV$. Thus, similarly to \eqref{eq:P_algebra}, we consider the completion of the symmetric algebra $S(\VV^*)$ as the \emph{formal power series} $\Ss(\VV^{*})$, which is in turn isomorphic to a quotient of \emph{tensor series algebra} $\T(\VV^*)$. This leads to 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:pToPol}
  e^{h\D}:\dP\to \Big\{\VV\to \VV\otimes \Ss(\VV^*)\Big\}.
 \end{equation}
 For any element $\vv_0\in \VV$, the expression $e^{h\D}(\cdot,\vv_0)$ is a map $\dP\to
 \VV\otimes \Ss(\VV^*)$, mapping a program to a formal power series (by switching the order of partial applications in \eqref{eq:pToPol}).

 We can express the
 correspondence between multi-tensors in $\VV\otimes T(\VV^*)$ and polynomial maps
 $\VV\to \VV$ given by multiple contractions for all possible indices. For a simple tensor $\uu\otimes
 f_1\otimes\ldots\otimes f_n\in \VV\otimes(\VV^*)^{\otimes n}$ the contraction by
 $\vv\in \VV$ is given by applying co-vector $f_n$ to $\vv$ \footnote{For order
   two tensors from $\VV\otimes\VV^*$ the contraction corresponds to
matrix vector multiplication.}
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:contraction}
 \uu\otimes f_1\otimes\ldots\otimes f_n\cdot \vv = f_n(\vv) \uu\otimes f_1\otimes\ldots f_{n-1}.
\end{equation}
By taking contraction multiple times, we can attach a monomial map to a
simple tensor by  
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:monomial}
 \uu\otimes f_1\otimes\ldots\otimes f_n\cdot (\vv)^{\otimes n} = f_n(\vv)f_{n-1}(\vv)\cdots f_1(\vv) \uu,
\end{equation}
Both contractions \eqref{eq:contraction} and \eqref{eq:monomial} are extended
by linearity to spaces $\VV\otimes \left(\VV^*\right)^{\otimes n}$ and further
to $\VV\otimes T(\VV^*)$.\footnote{Note that the simple order one tensor
  $\uu\in\VV$ can not be contracted by the vector $\vv$. To be consistent we
  define $\uu\cdot \vv = \uu$ and attach a constant map
  $\vv\mapsto \uu$ to order zero tensor $\uu$. The extension of
  \eqref{eq:monomial}
  to $\VV\otimes T(\VV^*)$ can be seen as a generalization of the affine map,
  where the zero order tensors account for translation.}
For a multi-tensor $\bfW=\bfw_0+\bfw_1+\ldots+\bfw_n\in\VV\otimes T_n(\VV^*)$,
where $\bfw_k\in\VV\otimes\left( \VV^*\right)^{\otimes k}$, applying the
contraction by a vector $\vv\in \VV$ multiple times yields a polynomial map
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:polynomial_tensor}
  \bfW(\vv) = \bfw_0+\bfw_1\cdot \vv+\ldots+\bfw_n\cdot (\vv)^{\otimes n}.
\end{equation}
\begin{theorem}\label{izr:e^d}
  For a program $P\in\dP$  the expansion into an infinite tensor series
  at the point $\vv_0\in \VV$ is expressed by multiple contractions 
  \begin{multline}\label{eq:tenzorVrsta}
  P(\vv_0+h\vv) = \Big((e^{h\D}P)(\vv_0)\Big)(\vv)
  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{h^n}{n!}\D^nP(\vv_0)\cdot (\vv^{\otimes n})\\
  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{h^n}{n!}\sum_{\forall_{i,\alpha}}\frac{\partial^nP_i}{\partial
        x_{\alpha_1}\ldots \partial x_{\alpha_n}}\e_i\cdot
      dx_{\alpha_1}(\vv)\cdot\ldots \cdot dx_{\alpha_n}(\vv).
  \end{multline}
\end{theorem}
 
 \begin{proof}
We will show that $\frac{d^n}{dh^n}\text{(LHS)}|_{h=0}=\frac{d^n}{dh^n}\text{(RHS)}|_{h=0}$. Then $\text{LHS}$ and $\text{RHS}$ as functions
of $h$ have coinciding Taylor series and are therefore equal.\\
 $\implies$
 
 $$\left. \frac{d^n}{dh^n}P(\vv_0+h\vv)\right|_{h=0}=\D^n P(\vv_0)(\vv)$$
 $\impliedby$
 $$\left. \frac{d^n}{dh^n}\left((e^{h\D})(P)(\vv_0)\right)(\vv)\right|_{h=0}=
\left. \left((\D^n e^{h\D})(P)(\vv_0)\right)(\vv)\right|_{h=0}$$
 $$\land$$
 $$\left. \D^ne^{h\D}\right| _{h=0}=\left. \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{h^i\D^{i+n}}{i!}\right|_{h=0}=\D^n$$
 $$\implies$$
 $$\left(\D^n(P)(\vv_0)\right)\cdot(\vv^{\otimes n})$$
 \end{proof}
 \begin{remark}\label{konvVrst}
 Theorem \ref{izr:e^d} can be generalized to convolutions using the Volterra series \cite{volterra}.
 \end{remark}
It follows trivially from the above theorem that the operator $e^\D$ is contained strictly within the language
\begin{equation}
  e^{h\D}(\dP_0)\subset\dP_0\otimes \T(\VV^*),
\end{equation}
 and that the operator $e^{h\D}$ is an automorphism of the programming algebra $\dP_\infty$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prod}
  e^{h\D}(p_1\cdot p_2)=e^{h\D}(p_1)\cdot e^{h\D}(p_2)
 \end{equation}
 where $\cdot$ stands for any bilinear map. 
 \begin{remark}[Generalized shift operator]\label{rmrk:genShift}
 The operator $e^{h\D}:\dP\times \VV\to \VV\otimes \T(\VV^*)$ evaluated at $h=1$
 is a broad generalization of the shift operator \cite{OpCalc}.
 \end{remark}
 
 For a specific $\vv_0\in\VV$, the generalized shift operator is denoted by
 \begin{equation*}
 e^\D\vert_{\vv_0}:\dP\to \VV\otimes \T(\VV^*)
 \end{equation*}
 When the choice of $\vv_0\in\VV$ is arbitrary, we omit it from expressions for brevity.

%  \begin{remark}
%  Independence of the operator $(\ref{eq:specProg})$ from a coordinate
%  system, translates to independence in execution. Thus the expression
%  $(\ref{eq:tenzorVrsta})$ is invariant to the point in execution of a program, a
%  fact we explore in Section \ref{sec:control}.   
% \end{remark}

%This part should be somehow included in the begining, how we will write operators that serve our purpose
%  \begin{remark}
  %Corollary $\ref{izr:P_n}$ through \eqref{eq:P_algebra} implies
         %$e^{h\D}(\dP_0)\subset\dP_0\otimes \T(\VV^*)$      
  %which enables efficient implementation by operator $\sumd$. 
 %\end{remark}


%Implement U combinator via this

\subsection{Operator of Program Composition}\label{sec:compsition}

In this section we implement the operator of program composition within the constructed algebraic language. Such a \emph{composer} can than be used to implement the analog of the \emph{U combinator} (which facilitates recursion) and other constructs. Furthermore, due to the differentiable nature of the language, such a \emph{composer} generalizes both forward (e.g. \cite{PcAD}) and reverse (e.g. \cite{ReverseAD}) mode of
 automatic differentiation of arbitrary order, unified under a single operator. Upon completion we will demonstrate how to perform calculations on the operator level, before they are applied to a particular programming space, which serves as a level of abstraction over the tensor series algebra of the memory space.
 
 \begin{theorem}[Program composition]\label{izr:kompo}
 Composition of maps $\dP$ is expressed as
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:kompo}
 e^{h\D}(f\circ g)=\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g,f)
 \end{equation}
 where $\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g}):\dP\times\dP\to\dP_\infty$ is an operator on pairs
 of maps $(g,f)$, where $\D_g$ is differentiation operator applied to the first
 component $g$, and $\D_f$ to the second component $f$. 
 \end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
  We will show that $\frac{d^n}{dh^n}\text{(LHS)}|_{h=0}=\frac{d^n}{dh^n}\text{(RHS)}|_{h=0}$. Then $\text{LHS}$ and $\text{RHS}$ as functions
  of $h$ have coinciding Taylor series and are therefore equal.\\
 $\implies$
 $$\lim\limits_{\lVert h\rVert\to 0}(\frac{d}{dh})^ne^\D(f\circ g)=\lim\limits_{\lVert h\rVert\to 0}\D^ne^{h\D}(f\circ g)$$
 $$\implies$$
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:kompproof1}
 \D^n(f\circ g)
 \end{equation}
 
 $\impliedby$
 $$\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})=\exp\left(\D_f\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{(h\D_g)^i}{i!}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}e^{\D_f\frac{(h\D_g)^i}{i!}}\Big(e^{\D_f}\Big)$$
 $$\implies$$
 $$\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g,f)=\sum\limits_{\forall_n}h^n\sum\limits_{\lambda(n)}\prod\limits_{k\cdot l\in\lambda}\Big(\frac{\D_f\D_g^l(g)}{l!}\Big)^k\frac{1}{k!}\Big(\Big(e^{\D_f}\Big)f\Big)$$
 where $\lambda(n)$ stands for the partitions of $n$. Thus
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:dComposite}
 \lim\limits_{\lVert h\rVert\to 0}(\frac{d}{dh})^n\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})=\sum\limits_{\lambda(n)}n!\prod\limits_{k\cdot l\in\lambda}\Big(\frac{\D_f\D_g^l(g)}{l!}\Big)^k\frac{1}{k!}\Big(\Big(e^{\D_f}\Big)f\Big)
 \end{equation}
 taking into consideration the fact that $e^{\D_f}(f)$ evaluated at a point $\vv\in \VV$ is the same as evaluating $f$ at $\vv$, the expression \eqref{eq:dComposite} equals \eqref{eq:kompproof1} by Faà di Bruno's formula.
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:dCompositePoint}
   \lim\limits_{\lVert h\rVert\to 0}(\frac{d}{dh})^n\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})=\sum\limits_{\lambda(n)}n!\prod\limits_{k\cdot l\in\lambda}\Big(\frac{\D_f\D_g^l(g(v))}{l!}\Big)^k\frac{1}{k!}\Big(f(g(\vv))\Big)
   \end{equation}
 \end{proof}       
 The Theorem $\ref{izr:kompo}$ enables an invariant implementation of the operator of program composition (i.e. the \emph{composer}) in $\dP_n$, expressed as a tensor series through $\eqref{eq:kompo}$ and $\eqref{eq:dComposite}$. 
 
  The operator of program composition 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:opGenKompo}
 \exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g}): \dP\to\dP\to\dP_\infty,
  \end{equation}
  allows two kinds of partial applications. The operator resulting from fixing the second map $g$ in \eqref{eq:opGenKompo},
  \begin{equation}
   \exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(\cdot,g)=g^*\left( e^{h\D} \right)\label{eq:opKompo}
 \end{equation}
  is the pullback of the generalized shift
  operator $e^{h\D}$ through $g$. While the operator resulting from fixing the first map $f$ in \eqref{eq:opGenKompo},
  \begin{equation}
 \exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(f,\cdot)=f_*\left( e^{h\D} \right)\label{eq:opKompoForward}
 \end{equation} 
 is the push-forward of the generalized shift operator $e^{h\D}$ through $f$.
This also generalizes the \emph{U combinator} to its forward and backward modes, by restricting the \emph{composers} \eqref{eq:opGenKompo} domain to a single function (i.e. $f$ and $g$ are the same mapping).
 
  \begin{remark}[Unified AD]\label{trd:reverseForward}
  Because of \eqref{eq:induced_map} and \eqref{eq:program_derivative} every program can be seen as $P=P_n\circ\ldots P_1$. Thus applying the operators
  $\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(\cdot,P_i)$ from $i=1$ to $i=n$ and projecting onto the space
  spanned by $\{1,\D\}$ is equivalent to forward mode automatic differentiation,
  while applying the 
  operators $\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(P_{n-i+1},\cdot)$ in reverse order (and
  projecting) is equivalent to reverse mode automatic differentiation.
 \end{remark}

   \begin{corollary}\label{izr:komp_homo}
   The operator $e^{h\D}$ commutes with composition over $\dP$
   \begin{equation*}
   e^{h\D}(p_2\circ p_1)=e^{h\D}(p_2)\circ e^{h\D}(p_1)
   \end{equation*}
   \end{corollary}
   
   \begin{proof}
   Follows from $\eqref{eq:pToPol}$ and Theorem $\ref{izr:kompo}$.
   \end{proof}

Such calculations can be made easier, by completing them on
the level of operators, thus avoiding the need to manipulate tensor series. This serves as a level of abstraction over the tensor series algebra of the memory space.

The derivative $\frac{d}{dh}$ of $\eqref{eq:opKompo}$ is 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:dexp}
 \frac{d}{dh}\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g)=\D_f(\D_gg)e^{h\D_g}\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g).
 \end{equation} 
 We note an important distinction to the operator $e^{h\D_g}$, the derivative of which is
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:de}
\frac{d}{dh}e^{h\D_g}=\D_ge^{h\D_g}.
 \end{equation}
 We may now compute derivatives (of arbitrary order) of the \emph{composer} itself.

\subsection{Example of an Operator Level Computation}\label{sec:example}

 For illustrative purposes we compute the second derivative of the \emph{composer} \eqref{eq:kompo}
 $$\left(\frac{d}{dh}\right)^2\exp\left(\D_fe^{h\D_g}\right)(g)=\frac{d}{dh}\left(\D_f(\D_gg)e^{h\D_g}\exp\left(\D_fe^{h\D_g}\right)(g)\right)$$
 which is by equations $\eqref{eq:dexp}$ and $\eqref{eq:de}$, using algebra and correct applications equal to
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:d^2comp}
 \left(\D_f(\D^2_gg)\right)e^{h\D_g}\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g)+(\D^2_f(\D_gg)^2)e^{2h\D_g}\exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})(g)
 \end{equation}
 The operator is always shifted to the evaluating point $\eqref{eq:specProg}$ $\vv\in \VV$, thus, only the behaviour in the limit as $h\to 0$ is of importance. Taking this limit in the expression $\eqref{eq:d^2comp}$ we obtain the operator
 \begin{equation*}
  \left(\D_f(\D^2_gg)+\D^2_f(\D_gg)^2\right)\exp(\D_f):\dP\to\D^2\dP(g)
 \end{equation*}
 
 Thus, without imposing any additional rules, we computed the operator of the second derivative of composition with $g$, directly on the level of operators. The result of course matches the equation $\eqref{eq:dComposite}$ for $n=2$.
 
 As it is evident from the example, calculations using operators are far
 simpler, than direct manipulations of tensor series. This enables a simpler
 implementation that functions over arbitrary programming spaces. In
 the space that is spanned by $\{\D^n\dP_0\}$ over $K$, derivatives of
 compositions may be expressed solely through the operators, using only the
 product rule $\eqref{eq:prod}$ and the derivative of the general shift operator
 $\eqref{eq:de}$. Thus, explicit knowledge of rules for differentiating
 compositions is unnecessary, as it is contained in the structure of the
 operator $exp(\D_fe^{h\D_g})$ itself, which is differentiated using standard
 rules, as shown by this example. 

 Similarly higher derivatives of the \emph{composer} can be computed on the
 operator level
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:dkompo}
 \D^n(f\circ g)=\left.\left(\frac{d}{dh}\right)^n\exp\left(\D_fe^{h\D_g}\right)(g,f)\right|_{h=0}.
 \end{equation}

 \subsection{Automatically differentiable derivatives}\label{sec:orderReduction}
 
 The ability to use $k$-th derivative of a program $P_1\in\dP$ as part of a differentiable program $P_2\in\dP$ appears useful in many fields (e.g. \cite{StatMC}). For that to be sensible, we must be able to treat the ($k$-th) derivative itself as a differentiable program $P^{\prime k}\in\dP$. This is what motivates the following theorem. 

\begin{theorem}[Order reduction]\label{izr:reductionMap}
There exists a reduction of order map $\phi:\dP_n\to \dP_{n-1}$, such that the
following  diagram commutes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reductionMap}
\begin{tikzcd}
  \dP_n \arrow{r}{\phi} \arrow{d}{\D} & 
  \dP_{n-1} \arrow{d}{\D}\\
  \dP_{n+1} \arrow{r}{\phi} & 
  \dP_{n}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
satisfying
\begin{equation*}
\forall_{P_1\in\dP_0}\exists_{P_2\in\dP_0}\Big(\phi^k\circ e^\D_n(P_1)=e^\D_{n-k}(P_2)\Big)
\end{equation*}
for each $n\ge 1$, where $e^\D_n$ is the projection of the operator $e^\D$ onto the set $\{\D^n\}$.
\end{theorem}  
\begin{corollary}[Differentiable derivative]\label{cor:extraxtDerivatives}
By Theorem \ref{izr:reductionMap}, $n$-differentiable $k$-th derivatives of a program $P\in\dP_0$ can be extracted by
\begin{equation*}
^{n}P^{k\prime}=\phi^k\circ e^\D_{n+k}(P)\in\dP_n
\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

Thus, by corollary \ref{cor:extraxtDerivatives}, the writing of differentiable programs that act on derivatives of other programs is well defined within the language. This is a crucial feature, as stressed by other authors \cite{AD1,AD2}. Note that in order to use $k$-th derivative of $P_2$ in an $n$-differentiable program $P_1$, then $P_2$ must have been $(k+n)$-differentiable before $\phi^k$ was applied to it.
